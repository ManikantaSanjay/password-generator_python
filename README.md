Topic:Password Generator

1>autopass.py-->Using my knowledge of python,making use of only string and random modules,i have created a simple  program that automatically generates password given the input no of characters in password. 


2>automatepassword.py-->No input required for this.It automatically generates password with a additional function to check if password is 
strong or not,making use of Words.txt file for the character strings.I have made use of passwordmeter,random,urllib.request,os.path and re modules.
